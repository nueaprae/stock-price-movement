# stock-price-movement
Build the LSTM model to predict the stock price movement based on financial news sentiment using Pytorch
I use FinBERT, a pre-trained NLP model, to label the financial news sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
Also, a BERT sentence transformer was used to filter headlines based on predefined stock-related keywords.
The dataset is The Guardian, CNBC, Reuters: https://www.kaggle.com/code/syedali110/financial-sentiment-analysis-using- linear-svc/notebook
and historical Reuters news that cannot be publicly shared.
