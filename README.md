# stock-price-movement
Build the LSTM model to predict the stock price movement based on financial news sentiment using Pytorch
I use FinBERT, a pre-trained NLP model, to label the financial news sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
Also, a BERT sentence transformer was used to filter headlines based on predefined stock-related keywords.
